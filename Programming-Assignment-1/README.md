In this programming assignment, we were asked to build/devise a linear regression model in Python completely from scratch. This assignment helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the linear regression model that was taught theoretically in class. I also gained familiarity with a wide range of techniques and methods like estimating the weights of linear regression using pinv etc.

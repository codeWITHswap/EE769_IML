In this programming assignment, we were asked to perform two different kinds of classification : binary classification as well as multi-class classification hence this helped me to learn how to train successful classification models. There were tasks wherein we had to use pre-trained neural network (ResNet18) to extract domain-specific features i.e. we learned how to use "ConvNet as a fixed feature extractor". Unlike the previus assignment, we were allowed to use libraries such as scikit-learn and hence we did not need to code anything from scratch.
